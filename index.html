    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Philosophy of Self</h2>
      <p>In a world full of answers, I live for the questions. I believe growth begins with reflection and that science and philosophy together help us make sense of the universe and ourselves. I read, I ponder, I play, and I question the world around me.</p>

      <h2>Books That Shape Me</h2>

      <h2>Science, Curiosity & Beyond</h2>
      <p>Every atom is a note in the symphony of the cosmos. I experiment, ask questions, and see science as a language the universe uses to speak. Whether it's energy, biology, or the mechanics of the mind, I explore them all with care and curiosity.</p>
